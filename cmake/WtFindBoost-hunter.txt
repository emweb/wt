#
# Separate compiled boost libraries are also discovered:
# - BOOST_FS_LIB
# - BOOST_PO_LIB
# - BOOST_SYSTEM_LIB
# - BOOST_THREAD_LIB (only if BOOST_MT_FOUND)
# Boost will try to find the same kind (mt or not) of library for all three
# of these libraries. Boost is considered to be found successfully only
# when the libraries are all of the same kind (mt or not). If the mt
# libraries exits, the mt versions will be used unless MULTI_THREADED is
# set to OFF. Otherwise, the non-mt versions will be used.
