### OpenSAML

If Wt Auth is built with SAML support, Wt also depends on OpenSAML (and its dependencies).

> :warning: **Note: The license for OpenSAML is Apache License 2.0. This license is not compatible with the GNU General
Public License v2 used by Wt**. As a consequence, unless you use the commercial Wt license, you may not distribute
derived works that use Wt with SAML support enabled.

These are additional dependencies if you enable SAML support:
