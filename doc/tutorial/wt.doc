== Introduction

Wt is a {cpp} library for developing web applications. Admitted, {cpp}
doesn't come to mind as the first choice for a programming language
when one talks about web development. Web development is usually
associated with scripting languages, and is usually implemented at the
level of generating responses for incoming requests. Since both
requests and responses are text encodings, web programming is
ultimately a text processing task, and thus conveniently expressed in
a scripting language.

Yet, from a functional point of view, and as a programming task, a
modern web application resembles more a desktop application: it is
highly interactive and no longer organized in pages (perhaps still
conceptually, but not physically). Interaction with the server happens
more and more in the background and not with complete page
refreshes. Indeed, the browser is being transformed into a platform
for applications where users interact with data and more often than
not with each other.

While some developers choose to implement the application in
JavaScript and use a client-server protocol to access server-side
resources, this has a number of inherent downsides. You need to let go
of static typing (or add another layer, such as GWT). Type safety,
enforced by a compiler, is invaluable as a project grows in complexity
and number of developers. Moreover, you need to design a client-server
protocol and minimize communication and associated round-trip
latencies. Finally, this approach cannot work for applications that
need to meet accessibility guidelines or need to be search engine
optimized and thus require a HTML-only version of the application. Wt,
as a server-side solution, overcomes these problems, and with
little to no interactivity loss compared to a JavaScript application.

Wt's main advantage over other server-side approaches is its *widget
abstraction*. An application is defined as a hierarchy of
widgets. Some of these widgets are generic and provided by the library
(like push buttons, line edits, table views, ...), and others are
specialized for a particular application (e.g. an entire blog
widget). A widget encapsulates the view and behavior aspects, consumes
and produces events and also participates in URL handling and may
interact with other HTTP resources. More often than not, a widget
delegates the actual "logic" to a model, a layering approach typically
known as MVC. A widget, unlike a page or “partlet”, is a truly
reusable, customizable and extensible building block (as a
poster-child of Object-Oriented Programming) for a modern web
application. The actual request handling and rendering is abstracted,
with as benefit that a full page rendering model (plain HTML) or
incremental updates (Ajax/WebSockets) can be used depending on
configuration and browser properties.

Although implemented in {cpp}, Wt's main focus or novelty is not its
performance, but its focus on developing maintainable applications and
its extensive library of built-in widgets. But because it is popular
and widely used in embedded systems, you will find that performance
and foot-print has been optimized too, by virtue of a no-nonsense API,
thoughtful architecture, and {cpp} ...

In this tutorial, we will use two small programs to illustrate how to
use Wt to create web applications. After this tutorial you should have
a good grasp of what the possibilities are, how Wt applications are
built, and how it offers you a tool to manage complexity.

The first application is the obligatory
http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/examples/hello/hello.wt[Hello World]
application and introduces two key concepts of the library: creating
and updating a widget tree and reacting to user input. The second,
slightly larger application is the classic
http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/examples/hangman-game/hangman.wt[ hangman
game]. Both applications are included in the Wt source distribution.

But before we dive in, let's quickly go over the main concepts of the
library.

== Main components

=== Widgets

The user-interface, rendered in a browser window, is specified by
creating and maintaining a widget tree. Every
{doc}classWt_1_1WWidget.html[widget] corresponds to a rectangular part
of the user-interface, and manages its contents and behavior. At the
heart, the library takes charge of two tasks within a single session:
(1) *rendering* this widget tree as HTML/JavaScript in the web
browser, and tracking changes as incremental updates, and (2)
*synchronizing user input* and *relaying events* from the browser to
these widgets.

Because of the clear separation between user-interface specification
using the widget tree and the rendering of the tree, the library
implements several optimizations for rendering when Ajax is
available. Not only can the library update the interface
incrementally, there are other tricks such as only rendering visible
widget changes during the response to an event (or initial loading),
and in the background render changes to hidden widgets. As a
consequence, both the initial response is optimized and the appearance
of subsequent widgets appears snappy.

=== Session management and lifetime

Another aspect that is entirely handled by the library is session
management. For every new session, which corresponds to a new user
accessing your web application, the library creates a new
+{doc}classWt_1_1WApplication.html[WApplication]+ object. As a
developer, you can implement an application pretty much as a
single-user application, unless you let users interact with a common
component (such as a database) or with each other, for which standard
data-sharing mechanisms must be used.

Depending on the deployment model, the library will map sessions onto
dedicated or shared processes. When using dedicated processes a new
process is created for every distinct session: this provides the
kernel-level isolation of different sessions, which may be useful for
highly security sensitive applications. When using shared processes
new sessions are allocated randomly to one of the processes available
to the library. This reduces the danger for DoS attacks, but requires
more careful programming as memory corruption affects all sessions in
a single process, and sessions are not isolated by any other mechanism
but correct programming.

Wt uses a keep-alive protocol between client and server to determine
session lifetime.  As long as the web page is displayed in the user's
browser, the session is kept alive. When the user closes his window,
navigates away, or after a timeout when connectivity is lost, the
session gets terminated. When a session is terminated, the application
object together with the entire widget tree is deleted, therefore you
should release resources held by your widgets or application in the
destructors of these objects.

=== Deployment

Several deployment options are available:

* The +wthttp+ connector library implements a webserver that
  implements HTTP(S) and WebSockets. It is not only convenient during
  development, but also an efficient solution for deployments ranging
  from small embedded systems or mobile devices to multi-server
  deployments.

* The +wtfcgi+ connector library implements the FastCGI protocol.
  It allows a Wt application to be integrated into an existing web server
  (such as Apache, Lighttpd or Nginx).

* The +wtisapi+ connector library implements the ISAPI protocol. On
  Windows platforms, it allows a Wt application to integrate into
  Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS).

== Hello, Wt

In http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/examples/hello/hello.wt[this example],
we show an application that prompts the user for his name. When he
pushes the button, the greeting text is updated based on the name that
was entered.

ifdef::basebackend-docbook[]
image::img/hello.svg["Hello World",height=250,align="center"]
endif::basebackend-docbook[]

ifndef::basebackend-docbook[]
image::img/hello.png[align="center"]
endif::basebackend-docbook[]

A new session starts with creating an instance of class
+{doc}classWt_1_1WApplication.html[WApplication]+. This object manages
the root of the widget tree and contains other session information,
such as the connected browser's capabilities.

.NOTE
****
The examples assume that you use a compiler with {cpp}14 support. If you
can only use use {cpp}11, you can use +Wt::cpp14::make_unique+ instead
of +std::make_unique+.
****

.A complete "Hello world" application
[source,cpp]
----
#include <Wt/WApplication.h>
#include <Wt/WBreak.h>
#include <Wt/WContainerWidget.h>
#include <Wt/WLineEdit.h>
#include <Wt/WPushButton.h>
#include <Wt/WText.h>

class HelloApplication : public Wt::WApplication
{
public:
    HelloApplication(const Wt::WEnvironment& env);

private:
    Wt::WLineEdit *nameEdit_;
    Wt::WText *greeting_;
};

HelloApplication::HelloApplication(const Wt::WEnvironment& env)
    : Wt::WApplication(env)
{
    setTitle("Hello world");

    root()->addWidget(std::make_unique<Wt::WText>("Your name, please? "));
    nameEdit_ = root()->addWidget(std::make_unique<Wt::WLineEdit>());
    Wt::WPushButton *button = root()->addWidget(std::make_unique<Wt::WPushButton>("Greet me."));
    root()->addWidget(std::make_unique<Wt::WBreak>());
    greeting_ = root()->addWidget(std::make_unique<Wt::WText>());
    auto greet = [this]{
      greeting_->setText("Hello there, " + nameEdit_->text());
    };
    button->clicked().connect(greet);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    return Wt::WRun(argc, argv, [](const Wt::WEnvironment& env) {
      return std::make_unique<HelloApplication>(env);
    });
}
----

You can build and run this application locally, if you want. All you
need to do is compile the code above and link against the Wt library
(+libwt+) and built-in HTTP server (+libwthttp+).

On UNIX-like systems, you could do the following:
----
$ g++ -std=c++14 -o hello hello.cc -lwthttp -lwt
$ ./hello --docroot . --http-address 0.0.0.0 --http-port 9090
----

.NOTE
****
If you get linking errors during the first step, you might need to
add more libraries:

----
$ g++ -std=c++14 -o hello hello.cc -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib
  -lwthttp -lwt -lboost_system -lboost_thread -lboost_filesystem
  -lboost_program_options
----
****

Let's start with the last part of the application, the +main()+
function.

In the +main()+ function, we call
+{doc}classWt_1_1WServer.html#abca6890dab44d87bd3af64705ac072d3[WRun()]+
to start the application server. This method will return when the
application server shuts down (by catching the TERM signal or the Windows
equivalent).

.Inside +WRun()+
****
+WRun()+ is actually a convenience function which creates and
configures a +{doc}classWt_1_1WServer.html[WServer]+ instance. If you want
more control, for example if you have multiple “entry points”, or want
to control the server starting and stopping, you can use the +WServer+
API directly instead.
****

The +WRun()+ function passes +argc+ and +argv+ (which for some
connectors such as the built-in webserver configures the server), and
accepts a function object as last argument. This function will be
called when a new session is started and returns a new +WApplication+
instance for that session. This function, in turn, has as input a
+{doc}classWt_1_1WEnvironment.html[WEnvironment]+ object, and this
object can be used to customize the application or authenticate the
user.

The example instantiates four widgets into the application's root
container: a text (+"Your name, please?"+), a line edit (+nameEdit_+),
an empty text (+greeting_+) and a button (+button+). These three types
of widgets are generic widgets provided by the library, and map
directly to native HTML elements. In the hangman example below we will
see how other custom and more specialized widgets are used in exactly
the same way.

After we instantiated the widgets, we specify that we want to react to
a click on the button. We connect the button's
+{doc}classWt_1_1WInteractWidget.html#ae11e050cce0d4a8f742afa3ef92bfe8c[clicked()]+
signal to the +greet+ function. Events propagate from one widget (the button) to other widgets
or, as in this case, the application object, using signals. A glimpse
at the reference documentation of a widget lists the signals that are
exposed by a particular widget. For basic widgets, such as a push
button, these are the typical
{doc}classWt_1_1WInteractWidget.html[mouse and keyboard
events]. Higher-level widgets may advertise other events (for example,
a {doc}classWt_1_1WCalendar.html[calendar widget]) has a
+selectionChanged()+ signal), and you can add events to your own
custom widgets.

.How event propagation works
*****************************
When an event is triggered by the user, the web browser communicates
the target object and corresponding signal together with all form data
to the web server (using a full page refresh or Ajax/WebSockets). At
the server, after the request has been validated as genuine, form data
such as line edit text is first processed to update the widget tree
state. Then, the event is propagated by emitting the signal from the
target widget, which propagates the event to all connected methods,
such as in our example the +greet+ function. Modifications to the widget
tree are tracked, and after the event has been handled these changes
are reflected on the rendered HTML DOM tree, again using a full page
refresh or incrementally using Ajax or WebSockets.
*****

The most interesting thing about the implementation of the +greet+
method may be the code that is not there: no JavaScript to update the
text using DOM manipulations or to re-render the page, no JavaScript
code to post the event and line edit value using Ajax or WebSockets,
no HTTP request decoding to interpret the line edit value or button
event, and no security-related code. All this is handled instead by
the library. While this could still be manageable for such a small
example, imagine a situation where the page contains various form
elements related to different tasks and thus managed by different
widgets, and where during event propagation many unrelated widgets get
updated.

== Hangman

For those of you who forgot the gameplay of hangman: the challenge is
to guess a word. You can pick a letter, one at a time. If the word
contains the chosen letter, it is indicated at the correct
location(s). If the word does not contain the letter, you loose a turn
and get one step closer to hanging. To win, you need to find the word
before you die hanging. In our version, we will let the user choose a
dictionary (English or Dutch), and we keep track of users and his
high-scores.

=== A first custom widget

We first discuss the HangmanWidget, which is a custom widget that
encapsulates the game itself: it allows a user to play one or more
games. It does not deal with updating the user's score, instead it
indicates score update events to other widget(s) using a signal.

The following screenshot shows how the widget is composed of different
widgets:

ifdef::basebackend-docbook[]
image::img/hangman.svg["Hangman",height=340,align="center"]
endif::basebackend-docbook[]

ifndef::basebackend-docbook[]
image::img/hangman.png[align="center"]
endif::basebackend-docbook[]

The HangmanWidget combines widgets provided by the library
(+{doc}classWt_1_1WText.html[WText]+: +title_+, +statusText_+,
+{doc}classWt_1_1WComboBox.html[WComboBox]+: +language_+), and three
custom widgets (+WordWidget+: +word_+, +ImagesWidget+: +images_+ and
+LettersWidget+: +letters+). As you will see, custom widgets are
instantiated and used in pretty much the same way as library widgets,
including reacting to events generated by these widgets.

With this information, we can implement the class definition.

.+HangmanWidget+ declaration
[source,cpp]
----
class HangmanWidget : public Wt::WContainerWidget
{
public:
    HangmanWidget(const std::string &name);

    Wt::Signal<int>& scoreUpdated() { return scoreUpdated_; }
  
private:
    Wt::WText        *title_;
    WordWidget       *word_;
    ImagesWidget     *images_;
    LettersWidget    *letters_;
    Wt::WText        *statusText_;
    Wt::WComboBox    *language_;
    Wt::WPushButton  *newGameButton_;
  
    Wt::Signal<int>   scoreUpdated_;

    std::string       name_;
    int               badGuesses_;

    void registerGuess(char c);
    void newGame();
};
----

This widget is implemented as a specialized
+{doc}classWt_1_1WContainerWidget.html[WContainerWidget]+. This is a
typical choice for widgets that combine other widgets in a simple
layout. We declare one public method +scoreUpdated()+, which provides access
to the signal that will be used to indicate changes to the user's
score as he plays through games. A
+{doc}classWt_1_1Signal[Signal<int>]+ used here, indicates that an
integer value will be passed as event information, and will reflect
the score update itself (positive when the user wins, or negative when
the user loses). Any function or object method with a signature
compatible with the signal may be connected to it and will receive the
score update.

The private section of the class declaration holds references to the
contained widgets, and state related to the game.

The constructor implementation shows some resemblance with the hello
world application we discussed earlier: widgets are instantiated and
event signals are bound. There are some novelties however.

.+HangmanWidget+ constructor
[source,cpp]
----
using namespace Wt;

HangmanWidget::HangmanWidget(const std::string &name)
    : name_(name),
      badGuesses_(0)
{
    setContentAlignment(AlignmentFlag::Center);
  
    title_ = addWidget(std::make_unique<WText>(tr("hangman.readyToPlay")));

    word_ = addWidget(std::make_unique<WordWidget>());
    statusText_ = addWidget(std::make_unique<WText>());
    images_ = addWidget(std::make_unique<ImagesWidget>(MaxGuesses));

    letters_ = addWidget(std::make_unique<LettersWidget>());
    letters_->letterPushed().connect(this, &HangmanWidget::registerGuess);

    language_ = addWidget(std::make_unique<WComboBox>());
    language_->addItem(tr("hangman.englishWords").arg(18957));
    language_->addItem(tr("hangman.dutchWords").arg(1688));

    addWidget(std::make_unique<WBreak>());

    newGameButton_ = addWidget(std::make_unique<WPushButton>(tr("hangman.newGame")));
    newGameButton_->clicked().connect(this, &HangmanWidget::newGame);

    letters_->hide();
}
----

Wt supports different techniques to layout widgets that may be
combined (see also the sidebar): namely widgets with CSS layout,
{doc}classWt_1_1WTemplate.html[HTML templates] with CSS layout, or
{doc}classWt_1_1WLayout.html[layout managers]. Here, we chose to use
the first approach, since we simply want to put everything vertically
centered.

.Other layout options
****
Although layout managers are a familiar concept in GUI development,
CSS is king of layout in web development. Some things are hard to do
with CSS though, in particular vertical centering or vertical size
adjustments. It is for this purpose that layout managers have been
added to Wt. These layout managers use JavaScript to compute the width
and/or height of widgets based on dimensions of other widgets.

Since Wt 4, some layouts use CSS and flexbox by default, which works
in many cases, but in some situations, you may want to opt for the
JavaScript implementation instead.
****

The +LetterWidget+ exposes a signal that indicates that the user chose
a letter. We connect a private method +registerGuess()+ to it, which
implements the game logic of dealing with a letter pick. Notice how
this event handling for a custom widget is no different than reacting
to an event from a push button, making that widget as much reusable as
the widgets provided by the library (assuming you are in the business
of hangman games).

To support internationalization, we use the +tr("key")+ function
(which is actually a method of +{doc}classWt_1_1WWidget[WWidget]+
which calls
+{doc}classWt_1_1WString#a0afc7dc0f9897456d71b569a86ca26c1[WString::tr()]+,
to lookup a (localized) string given a key. This happens in a message
resource bundle (see
+{doc}classWt_1_1WMessageResourceBundle[WMessageResourceBundle]+),
which contains locale-specific values for these strings. Values may be
substituted in these strings using a +`“{x}”`+ notation and the
+{doc}classWt_1_1WString.html#a167d99295d497bc37c11893c175e7e02[arg()]+
method of +WString+, as used for example for the
+“hangman.englishWords”+ string which has as actual English value
+“English words (\{1\} words)”+.

For completeness, we show below the rest of the HangmanWidget
implementation.

.+HangmanWidget+: game logic implementation
[source,cpp]
----
void HangmanWidget::newGame()
{
    WString title(tr("hangman.guessTheWord"));
    title_->setText(title.arg(name_));

    language_->hide();
    newGameButton_->hide();

    Dictionary dictionary = (Dictionary) language_->currentIndex();
    word_->init(RandomWord(dictionary));
    letters_->reset();
    badGuesses_ = 0;
    images_->showImage(badGuesses_);
    statusText_->setText("");
}

void HangmanWidget::registerGuess(char c)
{
    if (badGuesses_ < MaxGuesses) {
      bool correct = word_->guess(c);

      if (!correct) {
          ++badGuesses_;
          images_->showImage(badGuesses_);
      }
    }

    if (badGuesses_ == MaxGuesses) {
        WString status = tr("hangman.youHang");
        statusText_->setText(status.arg(word_->word()));

        letters_->hide();
        language_->show();
        newGameButton_->show();

        scoreUpdated_.emit(-10);
    } else if (word_->won()) {
        statusText_->setText(tr("hangman.youWin"));
        images_->showImage(ImagesWidget::HURRAY);

        letters_->hide();
        language_->show();
        newGameButton_->show();

        scoreUpdated_.emit(20 - badGuesses_);
    }
}

=== Unleashing (some of) Wt's power

Until now, we introduced a rather unique way to develop web
applications, and a powerful building block for reuse: the
widget. The next widget in the Hangman game that we will tackle, is
one we've already used just earlier: the +ImagesWidget+. It
illustrates an important aspect of the library that highly enhances
the user experience for users with an Ajax session (which should be
the majority of your users). One of the most appealing features of
popular web applications like Google's Gmail and Google Maps is an
excellent response time. Google may have spent quite some effort in
developing client-side JavaScript and Ajax code to achieve this. With
little effort – indeed almost automatically – you can get similar
responsiveness using Wt, and indeed the library will be using similar
techniques to achieve this. A nice bonus of using Wt is that the
application will still function correctly when Ajax or JavaScript
support is not available. The +ImagesWidget+ class, which we'll
discuss next, contains some of these techniques.  Hidden widgets are
prefetched by the browser, ready to be displayed when
+{doc}classWt_1_1WWidget.html#a52dcef5a385ddfa0a8c3e6c20000f181[show()]+
is called.

.+ImagesWidget+: implementation
[source,cpp]
----
ImagesWidget::ImagesWidget(int maxGuesses)
{ 
    for (int i = 0; i <= maxGuesses; ++i) { 
        std::string fname = "icons/hangman"; 
        fname += std::to_string(i) + ".jpg";
        WImage *theImage = addWidget(std::make_unique<WImage>(fname));
        images_.push_back(theImage);

        theImage->hide();
    } 

    WImage *hurray = std::make_unique<WImage>("icons/hangmanhurray.jpg");
    hurray->hide();
    images_.push_back(hurray);

    image_ = 0;
    showImage(maxGuesses);
} 

void ImagesWidget::showImage(int index) 
{
    image(image_)->hide();
    image_ = index;
    image(image_)->show();
}

WImage *ImagesWidget::image(int index) const
{
    return index == HURRAY ? images_.back() : images_[index];
}
----

In the constructor, we meet one more basic widget from the library:
+{doc}classWt_1_1WImage.html[WImage]+, which unsurprisingly corresponds
to an image in HTML. The code shows how widgets corresponding to each
state of the hangman example are created and added to our
+ImagesWidget+, which specializes a +WContainerWidget+. Each image is
also hidden – we'll want to show only one at a time, and this is
implemented in the +showImage()+ function.

But why do we create these images only to hide them? A valid
alternative could be to simply create the WImage that we want to show
and delete the previous, or even better, to simply manipulate the
image to point to another URL? The difference has to do with the
response time, at least when Ajax is available. The library first
renders and transfers information of visible widgets to the web
browser. When the visible part of web page is rendered, in the
background, the remaining hidden widgets are rendered and inserted in
the DOM tree. Web browsers will also preload the images referenced by
these hidden widgets. As a consequence, when the user clicks on a
letter button and we need to update the hangman image, we simply hide
and show the correct image widget, and this no longer requires a new
image to be loaded. An alternative implementation would have caused
the browser to fetch the new image, making the application appear
sluggish. Using hidden widgets is thus a simple and effective way to
preload contents in the browser and improve the responsiveness of your
application. Important to remember is that these hidden widgets do not
compromise the application load time, since visible widgets are
transferred first. A clear win-win situation thus.

=== Internal paths

Ignoring the login screen for a moment, then our application has two
main windows: the game itself and the high scores. These are
implemented by the +HangmanWidget+ which we discussed earlier, and a
+HighscoreWidget+ (which we will not be discussing in this
tutorial). Both are contained by a
+{doc}classWt_1_1WStackedWidget.html[WStackedWidget]+, which is a
container widget which shows only one of its contained children at a
time (and which, in all honesty we should have used to implement the
+ImagesWidget+, were it not that we wanted to explain a bit more about
preloading of contents). Unless we do something about it, a Wt
application presents itself as a single URL, and is thus a single-page
web application. This is not necessarily bad, but, it may be better to
support multiple URLs which allows a user to navigate within your
application, bookmark particular “pages”, or put links to them. It
also is instrumental to unlock the contents within your application to
search engine robots.  Wt provides you with a way to manage URLs which
are subpaths of the application URL, which are called “internal
paths”.

ifdef::basebackend-docbook[]
image::img/internalpath.svg["Internal path",height=170,align="center"]
endif::basebackend-docbook[]

ifndef::basebackend-docbook[]
image::img/internalpath.png[align="center"]
endif::basebackend-docbook[]

Internal paths are best used in combination with anchors (provided by
another basic widget, +{doc}classWt_1_1WAnchor.html[WAnchor]+). An
anchor can point either to external URLs, to private application
{doc}classWt_1_1WResource.html[resources] (which we'll not discuss
but are useful for dynamic non-HTML contents), or to internal
paths. When such an anchor is activated, this changes the
application's URL (as one could expect), and the
+{doc}classWt_1_1WApplication.html#a674fd6a2522d66d07908e8f3d82424a9[internalPathChanged()]+
signal is emitted. Thus, to respond to an internal path change, we
connect an event handler to this signal.

.Internal paths: a perfect illusion
****
Normally, when a user navigates a link, the browser fetches the
document linked to and replaces the current HTML page with the new
page. This system of "full page refreshes" causes the browser to
re-render the whole page each time, and is exactly what Ajax came to
avoid. Using new features in HTML 5 (JavaScript History support), and
falling back to tricks involving URL fragments in older browsers, Wt
creates the illusion of navigating to a new page, but instead uses
Ajax to update the page to reflect the URL change and navigation events.
At the same time, search engines and plain HTML sessions will view your
application using full page refreshes.
****

This is the implementation of the method that we connected:

.+HangmanGame+: internal path handling
[source,cpp]
----
void HangmanGame::handleInternalPath(const std::string &internalPath) 
{
    if (session_.login().loggedIn()) {
        if (internalPath == "/play")
            showGame();
        else if (internalPath == "/highscores")
            showHighScores();
        else
            WApplication::instance()->setInternalPath("/play",  true);
    }
}
----

Thus, if a user is logged in, we show the game when the path is
+“/play”+ and the high scores when the path is +“/highscores”+. For
good form, we redirect all other paths to +“/play”+ (which will end up
triggering the same function again). In our game we make
authentication (whether a user is currently logged in) orthogonal to
the internal paths: in this way a user may arrive at the game using
any internal path, log in, and automatically proceed with the function
for that internal path. You may imagine that this is what you want in
a complex application: the login function should not prevent the user
from directly going to a certain “page” within your application.

We did not discuss other parts of the hangman game example
application: namely how user scores are stored, and the authentication
system. Database access is implemented using a +Wt::Dbo+, which is a
{cpp} ORM that comes with Wt. {tutorials}dbo.html[This tutorial]
introduces the database layer. The authentication module, +Wt::Auth+,
as used in this example, is {tutorials}auth.html[introduced here].

== Summary

In this tutorial we provided you with the basic techniques for
creating web applications using Wt, from small to more complex. While
a tutorial is no place to discuss a real-life complex application,
with a small leap of faith, it should be clear that the same
techniques of creating an application using widgets as building
blocks, provides an effective way to manage complexity (and evolving
features), while freeing the application developer of many technical
aspects and quirks associated with the web platform. Because of the
many similarities between Wt and other GUI toolkits, developers can
treat the web browser in many aspects as just another GUI platform.

In this tutorial we touched on many important Wt features. But Wt adds
much more to your toolbox that weren't mentioned: file uploads,
dynamic resources, painting, tree and table views and their models, a
charting library, animation effects, WebSockets, built-in security
measures, authentication, etc... For more information, please see the
http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/documentation[online documentation].
