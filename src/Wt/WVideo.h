 *  \brief A video-playing widget.
 *
 * This is a low-level widget, mapping directly onto a
 * <tt>&lt;video&gt;</tt> element available in HTML5 compliant
 * browsers.
 *
 * In almost every situation you should use the WMediaPlayer widget
 * instead, which has fallback and flexible user-interface options.
 *
 * Usage of the video element consists of adding one or more video
 * sources and setting some options. Since not every browser supports
 * HTML5 video, the class provides a mechanism to display alternative
 * content in browsers that cannot play the video.
 *
 * \if cpp
 * Usage example:
 * \code
 * WVideo *v = addWidget(std::make_unique<WVideo>());
 * v->setOptions(WVideo::Autoplay | WVideo::Controls);
 * // Addsources may be called multiple times for different formats:
 * // Firefox only plays ogg
 * v->addSource("wt.ogv");
 * // many others play mp4
 * v->addSource("wt.mp4", "video/mp4");
 * // Image to be displayed before playback starts
 * v->setPoster("wt.jpg");
 * // You may display a simple text to explain that you need html5 support...
 * // v->setAlternativeContent(new WText("You have no HTML5 Video!"));
 * // ... or provide an alternative player, e.g. Flash-based
 * auto f = std::make_unique<WFlashObject>("player.swf");
 * f->setFlashVariable("startimage", "wt.jpg");
 * f->setFlashVariable("flv", "wt.mp4");
 * f->resize(640, 384);
 * v->setAlternativeContent(std::move(f));
 * \endcode
 * \endif
 *
 * There are two reasons why the a browser may use the alternative
 * content: either because the browser does not support the HTML5
 * video tag (alternative content is displayed even when JavaScript
 * is not available), or because none of the specified sources contain
 * a video format that is understood by the browser (requires
 * JavaScript to display the alternative content).
 *
 * The addSource() and setAlternativeContent() may not be called after
 * the widget is rendered.
 *
