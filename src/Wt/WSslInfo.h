/*! \class WSslInfo Wt/WSslInfo.h Wt/WSslInfo.h.C
 *  \brief Provides SSL information about the current session.
 *  
 * This class provides an interface to the SSL information related
 * to the current session. This class is returned by
 * WEnvironment::sslInfo().
 *
 * Probably the most important use of this class is that it provides
 * access to the client certificate which was presented by the
 * client during an https handshake to authenticate the SSL session.
 * This class collects the information on the verification that was
 * performed by the connector (FCGI, ISAPI, the built-in webserver, ...)
 * and presents it to the application programmer.
 *
 * The verification and the acceptance of the certificate has to be
 * configured in the web server (built-in httpd, Apache, IIS, ...).
 * When WEnvironment::sslInfo() returns a WSslInfo object, this means
 * that the client verification has already passed the verification
 * procedures in the webserver. This does not mean that the
 * certificate is valid; depending on the configuration of your web
 * server, this verification may be weak. Always check the
 * verification result with clientVerificationResult().
 *
 * This class is only available when %Wt was compiled with SSL support.
