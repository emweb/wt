 *  \brief A widget that is painted using vector graphics.
 *
 * A painted widget is rendered from basic drawing
 * primitives. Rendering is done not on the server but on the browser,
 * using different rendering methods:
 *
 * <table>
 *   <tr><td><b>Browser</b></td><td><b>Methods</b></td>
 *       <td><b>Default method</b></td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Firefox 1.5+</td><td>HtmlCanvas, InlineSVG, PngImage</td>
 *       <td>HtmlCanvas</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Internet Explorer 6.0+</td><td>InlineVML, PngImage</td>
 *       <td>InlineVML</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Internet Explorer 9+</td><td>HtmlCanvas, InlineSVG, PngImage</td>
 *       <td>HtmlCanvas</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Safari</td><td>HtmlCanvas, InlineSVG, PngImage</td>
 *       <td>HtmlCanvas</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Opera</td><td>InlineSVG, HtmlCanvas*, PngImage</td>
 *       <td>InlineSVG</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>other</td><td>?</td><td>HtmlCanvas, PngImage</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <i>* HtmlCanvas occasionally suffers from rendering artefacts in Opera.</i>
 *
 * The different rendering methods correspond to different
 * WPaintDevice implementations, from which this widget choses a
 * suitable one depending on the browser capabilities and configuration.
 *
 * If no JavaScript is available, the JavaScript-based HtmlCanvas will
 * not be used, and InlineSVG will be used instead. The method used
 * may be changed by using setPreferredMethod().
 *
 * In some browsers, InlineSVG requires that the document is rendered as
 * XHTML. This must be enabled in the configuration file using the
 * <tt>&lt;send-xhtml-mime-type&gt;</tt> option. By default, this
 * option is off. Firefox 4 and Chrome do support svg in normal html mode.
 *
 * The PngImage is the most portable rendering method, and may be the
 * fastest if the painting is of high complexity and/or the image is
 * fairly small.
 *
 * To use a %WPaintedWidget, you must derive from it and reimplement
 * paintEvent(WPaintDevice *paintDevice). To paint on a WPaintDevice,
 * you will need to use a WPainter. Repainting is triggered by calling
 * the update() method.
 *
 * \if cpp
 * Usage example:
 * \code
 * class MyPaintedWidget : public Wt::WPaintedWidget
 * {
 * public:
 *   MyPaintedWidget()
 *     : Wt::WPaintedWidget()
 *       foo_(100)
 *   {
 *      resize(200, 200); // provide a default size
 *   }
 *
 *   void setFoo(int foo) {
 *      foo_ = foo;
 *      update(); // trigger a repaint
 *   }
 *
 * protected:
 *   void paintEvent(Wt::WPaintDevice *paintDevice) {
 *     Wt::WPainter painter(paintDevice);
 *     painter.drawLine(20, 20, foo_, foo_);
 *     ...
 *   }
 *
 * private:
 *   int foo_;
 * };
 * \endcode
 * \endif
 * 
 * <h3>CSS</h3>
 *
 * Styling through CSS is not applicable.
 *
 * \note A %WPaintedWidget requires that it is given a size using resize() or
 *       by a layout manager.
 *
 * <h3>Client side interaction and repainting</h3>
 *
 * If the widget is drawn as an HTML canvas element, i.e. the \link getMethod() method\endlink
 * is HtmlCanvas, a %WPaintedWidget can expose certain objects to be modified client side.
