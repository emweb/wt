/*! \class WGLWidget Wt/WGLWidget Wt/WGLWidget
 *  \brief WebGL support class
 *
 * The WGLWidget class is an interface to the HTML5 WebGL infrastructure. Its
 * implementation started based on the working drafts of the Khronos group, and
 * will be updated as the standard stabilizes.
 *
 * The goal of the WGLWidget class is to provide a method to render 3D
 * structures in the browser, where rendering and rerendering is normally
 * done in JavaScript without interaction from the server, unless the
 * scene requires updates.
 *
 * This widget is work in progress. The API may change in the future because
 * of new features, reorganizations or changes in the WebGL draft.
 *
 * For this purpose, the JavaScript functions to render the class are cached
 * on the browser. There are four functions that you may implement in a
 * specialization of this class:
 * <ul>
 * <li>initializeGL(): this function is executed only once, right after the
 *     successful detection of WebGL in the browser. (note: in future versions,
 *     it may be re-executed when the webglcontextlost signal is fired, but
 *     this is currently not yet implemented). This is the ideal location to
 *     compose shader programs, send VBO's to the client, extract uniform and
 *     attribute locations, ... Due to the presence of VBO's, this function
 *     may generate a large response to the client.
 * <li>resizeGL(): this function is executed whenever the canvas dimensions
 *     change. A change in canvas size will require you to invoke the
 *     viewport() function again, as well as recalculate the projection
 *     matrices (especially when the aspect ratio has changed). Thie
 *     resizeGL() function is therefore the ideal location to set those
 *     properties.
 *     The resizeGL() function is invoked automatically on every resize,
 *     and after the first initializeGL() invocation. Additional invocations
 *     may be triggered by calling repaint() with the RESIZE_GL flag.
 * <li>paintGL(): this is the workhorse. It is executed every time that the
 *     scene is to be redrawn. You can use the VBO's and shaders prepared
 *     in the initializeGL() phase. Usually, this function sets uniforms
 *     and attributes, links attributes to VBO's, applies textures, and
 *     draws primitives.
 *     You may also create local programs, buffers, ... Remeber that this
 *     function is executed a lot of times, so every buffer/program created
 *     in this function should also be destroyed to avoid memory leaks.
 *     This function is transmitted once to the client, and is executed
 *     when the scene needs to be redrawn. Redraws may be triggered from
 *     mouse events, timer triggers, events on e.g. a video element, or
 *     whatever other event.
 *     The paintGL() function can be updated through invoking repaintGL()
 *     with the PAINT_GL flag.
 * <li>updateGL(): VBO's, programs, uniforms, GL properties, or anything
 *     else set during intializeGL() are not necessarily immutable. If
 *     you want to change, add, remove or reconfigure those properties,
 *     the execution of an updateGL() function can be triggered by invoking
 *     repaintGL() with the UPDATE_GL flag. This signals that updateGL()
 *     needs to be evaluated - just once.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The WebGL functions are intended to be used exclusively from within the
 * invocation of the four callback functions mentioned above. In order to
 * manually trigger the execution of these function, use the repaintGL().
 *
 * A WGLWidget must be given a size explicitly, or must be put inside a
 * layout manager that manages its width and height. The behaviour of a
 * WGLWidget that was not given a size is undefined.
 *
 *
 * Client side matrices.
 * The WGLWidget has a mechanism to use client-side modifiable matrices
 * in the render functions. These matrices can be used identically to the
 * 'constant', with the advantage that there is no need to have a
 * roundtrip to the server to redraw the scene when they are changed.
 * As such, they are ideal for mouse-based camera manipulations, timer
 * triggered animations, or object manipulations.
 *
 * Note: the client side matrices are currently not yet communicated back
 * to the server, but that is an implementation idea for the future.

   * the cached client-side paint function.
   */
  virtual void resizeGL(int width, int height);

  /*! \brief Update the client-side painting function.
   *
   * This method is invoked client-side when a repaint is required,
   * i.e. when the repaintSlot() (a JavaScript-side JSlot) is triggered.
   * Typical examples are: after mouse-based camera movements, after
   * a timed update of a camera or an object's position, after
   * a resize event (resizeGL() will also be called then), after
   * an animation event, ... In many cases, this function will be
   * executed client-side many many times.
   *
   * Using the WebGL functions from this class, you construct a scene.
   * The implementation tracks all JavaScript calls that need to be
   * performed to draw the scenes, and will replay them verbatim on
   * every trigger of the repaintSlot(). There are a few mechanisms
   * that may be employed to change what is rendered without updating
   * the paintGL() cache:
   * <ul>
   * <li>Client-side matrices may be used to change camera viewpoints,
   *     manipilate separate object's model transformation matrices, ...
   *     </li>
   * <li>Shader sources can be updated without requiring the paint
   *     function to be renewed</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * Updating the paintGL() cache is usually not too expensive; the VBOs,
   * which are large in many cases, are already at the client side, while
   * the paintGL() code only draws the VBOs. Of course, if you have to
   * draw many separate objects, the paintGL() JS code may become large
   * and updating is more expensive.
   *
   * In order to update the paintGL() cache, call repaintGL() with
   * the PAINT_GL parameter, which will cause the invocation of this
   * method.
