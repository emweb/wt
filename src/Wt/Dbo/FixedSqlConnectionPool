 * startup time, and the pool will not grow as more connections are needed.

 * This is adequate when the number of threads (which need different
 * connections to work with) is also bounded, like when using a fixed
 * size thread pool. This is for example the case when used in
 * conjunction with %Wt. Note that you do not need as many connections
 * as sessions, since Session will only use a connection while
 * processing a transaction.
