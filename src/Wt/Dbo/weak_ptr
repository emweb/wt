/*! \class weak_ptr Wt/Dbo/weak_ptr Wt/Dbo/weak_ptr
 *  \brief A weak pointer for a database object.
 *
 * A weak_ptr has similar API and capabilities as a ptr, but does not
 * actually store a reference to the object itself. Instead, it uses
 * a query to retrieve the object.
 *
 * It is used only to implement a OneToOne relation:
 * - class A hasOne class B object, in a weak_ptr
 * - class B belongsTo a class A object, in a ptr
 *
 * This cannot be implemented using two plain ptr's because otherwise
 * a cycle would be created which interferes with the count-based
 * shared pointer implementation of ptr.
 *
 * Only in a OneToOne relation, the required querying logic for the
 * weak_ptr to function properly is provided by the hasOne() call, and thus
 * a weak_ptr cannot be used outside of a OneToOne relation.
 *
 * The weak_ptr has almost the same capabilities as a ptr, except that
 * it does not provide a dereference operator (*).
 *
 * It's important to realize that reading a weak_ptr results in a
 * query, and thus you may want to first convert the weak_ptr into a
 * plain ptr when needing multiple operations.
