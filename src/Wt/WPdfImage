 *  \brief A paint device for rendering to a PDF.
 *
 * A %WPdfImage paint device should be used in conjunction with a
 * WPainter, and can be used to make a PDF version of a
 * WPaintedWidget's contents.
 *
 * The PDF is generated using <a href="http://libharu.org/">The Haru
 * Free PDF Library</a>, and this class is included in the library
 * only if <tt>libharu</tt> was found during the build of the library.
 *
 * You can use the image as a resource and specialize handleRequest()
 * to paint the contents on the fly. Alternatively can also use
 * write() to serialize to a PDF file (std::ostream). The latter usage
 * is illustrated by the code below:
 *
 * \code Wt::Chart::WCartesianChart
 * *chart = ...
 *
 * Wt::WPdfImage pdfImage("4cm", "3cm");
 * {
 *   Wt::WPainter p(&pdfImage);
 *   chart->paint(p);
 * }
 * std::ofstream f("chart.pdf", std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);
 * pdfImage.write(f);
 * \endcode
 *
 * A constructor is provided which allows the generated PDF image to
 * be embedded directly into a page of a larger <tt>libharu</tt>
 * document, and this approach is used for example by the WPdfRenderer
 * to render XHTML to multi-page PDF files.
 *
 * Font information is embedded in the PDF. Fonts supported are native
 * PostScript fonts (Base-14) (only ASCII-7), or true type fonts
 * (Unicode). See addFontCollection() for more information on how
 * fonts are located and matched to WFont descriptions.
 *
 * This paint device has the following limitations:
 * - images (WPainter::drawImage()) can only be included from local
 * files, and only JPG and PNG images are supported.
 * - drop shadows are not supported.

  /*! \brief Adds a font collection.
   *
   * If %Wt has been configured to use <tt>libpango</tt>, then font
   * matching and character selection is done by libpango, which is
   * seeded with information on installed fonts by fontconfig. In that
   * case, invocations for this method is ignored. Only TrueType fonts
   * are supported, and thus you need to configure fontconfig (which
   * is used by pango) to only return TrueType fonts. This can be
   * done using a fonts.conf configuration %file:
   *
   * \htmlonly
   * <pre>
&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'&gt;
&lt;fontconfig&gt;
    &lt;selectfont&gt;
      &lt;rejectfont&gt;
	 &lt;glob&gt;*.pfb&lt;/glob&gt;
      &lt;/rejectfont&gt;
    &lt;/selectfont&gt;
&lt;/fontconfig&gt;
   * </pre>
   * \endhtmlonly
   * You may need to add more glob patterns to exclude other fonts
   * than TrueType, and also to exclude TrueType fonts which do not
   * work properly with libharu.
   *
   * If %Wt has not been configured to use <tt>libpango</tt>, then
   * this method may be used to indicate the location of TrueType
   * fonts. The main drawback compared to libpango is that font
   * selection is not steered by the need for particular characters,
   * i.e. font selection is independent from the text's need for
   * specific characters. Most TrueType fonts provided only partial
   * unicode support. The provided \p directory will be searched for
   * fonts (currently only TrueType ".ttf" or ".ttc" fonts). TrueType
   * fonts are preferable over Base-14 fonts (which are PDF's default
   * fonts) since they provide partial (or complete) unicode support.
   *
   * When using Base-14 fonts, WString::narrow() will be called on text
   * which may result in loss of information.
