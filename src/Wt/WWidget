 *  \brief The abstract base class for a user-interface component.
 *
 * The user-interface is organized in a tree structure, in which each
 * node is a widget. All widgets, except for the application's root
 * widget and dialogs, have a parent which is usually a
 * WContainerWidget.
 *
 * \if cpp
 *
 * When a widget is deleted, it is also visually removed from the
 * user-interface and all children are deleted recursively.
 *
 * \endif
 *
 * This is an abstract base class. Implementations derive either from
 * the abstract WWebWidget (for basic widgets with a direct HTML
 * counter-part) or from the abstract WCompositeWidget (for anything
 * else). To add a %WWebWidget directly to a parent container, either
 * specify the parent in the constructor (which is conventionally the
 * last constructor argument), or add the widget to the parent using
 * WContainerWidget::addWidget(). Alternatively, you may add the widget
 * to a layout manager set for a %WContainerWidget.
 *
 * A widget provides methods to manage its decorative style base on
 * CSS. It also provides access to CSS-based layout, which you may not
 * use when the widget is not inserted into a layout manager.
