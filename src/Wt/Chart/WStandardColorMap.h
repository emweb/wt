/*! \class WStandardColorMap
 *  \brief Standard colorMap
 * 
 * The %WStandardColorMap is defined by a list of value-to-color pairs. The 
 * %WStandardColorMap has two modes: a continuous mode, in which the colors 
 * are linearly interpolated in between the pair values, and a 
 * non-continuous mode, where the values are not interpolated, so that the 
 * colormap has a banded effect. In non-continuous mode, the color of a 
 * given point P is the color of the pair with the largest value smaller than 
 * P.
 *
 * Numerical values above the maximum value in the list map to the maximum 
 * value's color, all values below the minimum value in the list map to the 
 * minimum value's color. The range indicated by the minimum and maximum passed 
 * to the constructor determines which part of the colormap is drawn by 
 * createStrip() or paintLegend().
 *
 * The figure below illustrates the possible colormaps that can be constructed 
 * from the list {"0.0 - StandardColor::DarkRed", "1.0 - StandardColor::Red",
 * "2.0 - StandardColor::Gray"}. The discrete map 
 * (on the left) has the range [0, 3], the continuous map (on the right) has  
 * the range [0, 2]. The utility-method \ref discretise() is also applied to 
 * the continuous colormap to obtain a colormap with 5 bands in the same range.
