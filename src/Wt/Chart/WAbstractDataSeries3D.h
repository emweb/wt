/*! \class WAbstractDataSeries3D
 *  \brief Abstract base class for dataseries that can be drawn on a 
 * WCartesian3DChart
 *
 * <h3>General</h3>
 * 
 * The model that is provided at construction or with setModel() contains the 
 * data of a dataseries. Implementations of this class format the data for 
 * representation on the chart and perform all necessary drawing operations. 
 * Note that if a dataseries holds numerical data it should be added to a chart 
 * of type \ref ChartType::Scatter, if it holds categorical data it should be added to 
 * a chart of type \ref ChartType::Category.
 *
 * <h3>Color</h3>
 *
 * The color used to draw data on a chart can be specified in a number of ways. 
 * The priority of this is as follows (1 being the highest):
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>\c ItemDataRole::MarkerBrushColor set on a value in the model</li>
 * <li>WAbstractColorMap set on the dataseries</li>
 * <li>WChartPalette present in the chart</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * A chart-palette will specify one color for the entire dataseries. Each new 
 * dataseries on a chart will receive another color.\n A colormap assigns
 * different colors to the data within one dataseries, based on the z-value of 
 * the data. WStandardColorMap provides an easy way to create a colormap that 
 * is either smooth or consists of a number of bands.
 *
 * <h3>Data-roles</h3>
 *
 * The roles on the model which are taken into account are:\n
 * <ul>
 * <li>\c ItemDataRole::MarkerBrushColor: this determines the color of a datapoint and overrides the default</li>
 * <li>\c ItemDataRole::MarkerScaleFactor: this determines the size of a datapoint and overrides the default</li>
 * </ul> 
 *
 * Some representations of the data ignore these roles. For example, when a 
 * surface is drawn, the roles are ignored.
 *
 * <h3>Implementing a new dataseries class</h3>
 * 
 * When the existing implementations of %WAbstractDataSeries3D don't meet your 
 * needs, you might want to make your own. When doing this there are some 
 * details of the chart that you should know. The chart is made so that when 
 * a property of the chart changes, which affect any of the GL resources, 
 * all GL resources are destroyed and re-initialized. This eliminates the need 
 * to determine which chart-setting affect which GL-resources, which can be 
 * a complicated problem.
 *
 * Therefore only unchanging GL resources are initialized in initializeGL(). 
 * The initializeGL function in the chart is implemented to immediately request 
 * a call to updateGL(), which then initializes the rest of the GL resources. 
 * Every call to updateGL in the chart, will first call deleteAllGLResources() 
 * on all dataseries and will then call updateGL() on all dataseries. So, when 
 * implementing a dataseries: initialize unchanging GL resources in 
 * initializeGL(), initialize the rest of your GL resources in updateGL() and 
 * make GL-delete calls to all resources initialized in updateGL() in the 
 * function deleteAllGLResources(). It is also best to check isNull() on each 
 * of your GL-resources when deleting them.
