 *  \brief An object which can be rendered in the HTTP protocol.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * Besides the main page, other objects may be rendered as additional
 * resources, for example documents or images. Classes such as WAnchor
 * or WImage can use a resource instead of a URL to provide their
 * contents. Whenever the resource has changed, you should call the
 * setChanged() method. setChanged() will make sure that the browser will
 * use a new version of the resource by generating a new URL, and emits the
 * dataChanged() signal to make those that refer to the resource aware
 * that they should update their references to the new URL.
 *
 * You can help the browser to start a suitable helper application to
 * handle the downloaded resource, or suggest to the user a suitable
 * filename for saving the resource, by setting an appropriate file
 * name using suggestFileName().
 *
 * To serve resources that you create on the fly, you need to specialize
 * this class and implement handleRequest().
 * 
 * \if cpp
 * Example for a custom resource implementation:
 * \code
 * class MyResource : public Wt::WResource
 * {
 * public:
 *   MyResource()
 *   {
 *     suggestFileName("data.txt");
 *   }
 *
 *   ~MyResource() {
 *     beingDeleted(); // see "Concurrency issues" below.
 *   }
 *
 *   void handleRequest(const Wt::Http::Request& request,
 *                      Wt::Http::Response& response) {
 *     response.setMimeType("plain/text");
 *     response.out() << "I am a text file." << std::endl;
 *   }
 * };
 * \endcode
 * \endif
 *
 * <h3>Concurrency issues</h3>
 *
 * Because of the nature of the web, a resource may be requested one
 * time or multiple times at the discretion of the browser, and
 * therefore your resource should in general not have any side-effects
 * except for what is needed to render its own contents. Unlike event
 * notifications to a %Wt application, resource requests are not
 * serialized, but are handled concurrently. You need to grab the
 * application lock if you want to access or modify other widget state
 * from within the resource. When deleting a resource, any pending
 * request is cancelled first. For this mechanism to work you need to
 * specialize the destructor and call beingDeleted(). This method may
 * safely be called multiple times (i.e. from within each destructor
 * in the hierachy).
 *
 * <h3>Continuations for asynchronous I/O</h3>
 *
 * With respect to I/O, the current strategy is to cache the whole
 * response first in a buffer and use async I/O to push the data to
 * the client, in order to free the thread while waiting for I/O on a
 * possibly slow link. You do not necessarily have to provide all
 * output at once, instead you can obtain a Http::ResponseContinuation
 * object for a response, construct the response piecewise. A new
 * request() will be made to continue the response.
 *
 * Example for a custom resource implementation using continuations:
 * \code
class MyResource : public Wt::WResource
{
public:
  MyResource(int iterations)
    : iterations_(iterations)
  {
    suggestFileName("data.txt");
  }

  ~MyResource() {
    beingDeleted();
  }

  void handleRequest(const Wt::Http::Request& request,
                     Wt::Http::Response& response) {
    // see if this request is for a continuation:
    Wt::Http::ResponseContinuation *continuation = request.continuation();

    // calculate the current start
    int iteration = continuation ? Wt::cpp17::any_cast<int>(continuation->data()) : 0;
    if (iteration == 0)
      response.setMimeType("plain/text");

    int last = std::min(iterations_, iteration + 100);
    for (int i = iteration; i < last; ++i)
      response.out() << "Data item " << i << std::endl;

    // if we have not yet finished, create a continuation to serve more
    if (last < iterations_) {
      continuation = response.createContinuation();
      // remember what to do next
      continuation->setData(last);
    }
  }

private:
  int iterations_;
};
 * \endcode
 *
 * <h3>Global and private resources</h3>
 *
 * By default, a resource is private to an application: access to it
 * is protected by same secret session Id that protects any other
 * access to the application.
 *
 * You can also deploy static resources, which are global, using
 * WServer::addResource().
 *
 * <h3>Monitoring upload progress</h3>
 *
 * A resource may also handle the uploading of files (in fact,
 * WFileUpload uses a WResource to do exactly that) or transmission of
 * other large bodies of data being POST'ed or PUT to the resource
 * URL. For these requests, it may be convenient to enable upload
 * progress monitoring using setUploadProgress(), which allows you to
 * be notified of data being received.
