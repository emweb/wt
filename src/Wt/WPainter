/*! \defgroup painting Painting system
    \brief Classes that provide support for vector graphics painting

  %Wt provides a vector graphics painting system, which depending on
  the browser support, uses one of four different methods to paint the
  graphics (inline SVG, inline VML, HTML 5 &lt;canvas&gt; or a raster
  image). Vector graphics has as benefit a lower bandwidth usage
  compared to raster images, indepedent of the image size. To use the
  paint system, you need to specialize WPaintedWidget and use a
  WPainter to paint the contents of the widget inside its
  WPaintedWidget::paintEvent().

  In addition, a PDF backend is included in the library, which can be used
  to make a PDF version of a painting, or to embed a painting in a
  PDF document.

  To use inline SVG, you need to enable xhtml support in your
  configuration file by enabling send-xhtml-mimetype, see \ref
  config_general.

/*! \class WPainter Wt/WPainter Wt/WPainter
 *  \brief Vector graphics painting class.
 *
 * The painter class provides a vector graphics interface for
 * painting. It needs to be used in conjunction with a WPaintDevice,
 * onto which it paints. To start painting on a device, either pass
 * the device through the constructor, or use begin().
 *
 * A typical use is to instantiate a %WPainter from within a
 * specialized WPaintedWidget::paintEvent() implementation, to paint
 * on the given paint device, but you can also use a painter to paint
 * directly to a particular paint device of choice, for example to
 * create SVG, PDF or PNG images (as resources).
 *
 * The painter maintains state such as the current \link setPen()
 * pen\endlink, \link setBrush() brush\endlink, \link setFont()
 * font\endlink, \link shadow() shadow\endlink, \link worldTransform()
 * transformation\endlink and clipping settings (see setClipping() and
 * setClipPath()). A particular state can be saved using save() and
 * later restored using restore().
 *
 * The painting system distinguishes between device coordinates,
 * logical coordinates, and local coordinates. The device coordinate
 * system ranges from (0, 0) in the top left corner of the device, to
 * (device->width().toPixels(), device->height().toPixels()) for the
 * bottom right corner. The logical coordinate system defines a
 * coordinate system that may be chosen independent of the geometry of
 * the device, which is convenient to make abstraction of the actual
 * device size. Finally, the current local coordinate system may be
 * different from the logical coordinate system because of a
 * transformation set (using translate(), rotate(), and
 * scale()). Initially, the local coordinate system coincides with the
 * logical coordinate system, which coincides with the device
 * coordinate system.
 *
 * The device coordinates are defined in terms of pixels. Even though
 * most underlying devices are actual vector graphics formats, when
 * used in conjunction with a WPaintedWidget, these vector graphics
 * are rendered by the browser onto a pixel-based canvas (like the
 * rest of the user-interface). The coordinates are defined such that
 * integer values correspond to an imaginary raster which separates
 * the individual pixels, as in the figure below.
 *
 * \image html WPainter.png "The device coordinate system for a 6x5 pixel device"
 *
 * As a consequence, to avoid anti-aliasing effects when drawing
 * straight lines of width one pixel, you will need to use vertices
 * that indicate the middle of a pixel to get a crisp one-pixel wide
 * line, as in the example figure.
 *
 * By setting a viewPort() and a window(), a viewPort transformation
 * is defined which maps logical coordinates onto device
 * coordinates. By changing the world transformation (using
 * setWorldTransform(), or translate(), rotate(), scale() operations),
 * it is defined how current local coordinates map onto logical
 * coordinates.
 *
 * The painter provides support for clipping using an arbitrary \link
 * WPainterPath path\endlink, but not that the %WVmlImage paint device
 * only has limited support for clipping.
 *
 * \if cpp
 * Usage example:
 * \code
 * class MyPaintedWidget : public Wt::WPaintedWidget
 * {
 * public:
 *   MyPaintedWidget(Wt::WContainerWidget *parent = 0)
 *     : Wt::WPaintedWidget(parent),
 *       foo_(100)
 *   {
 *      resize(200, 200); // provide a default size
 *   }
 *
 *   void setFoo(int foo) {
 *      foo_ = foo;
 *      update(); // trigger a repaint
 *   }
 *
 * protected:
 *   void paintEvent(Wt::WPaintDevice *paintDevice) {
 *     Wt::WPainter painter(paintDevice);
 *     painter.drawLine(20, 20, foo_, foo_);
 *     ...
 *   }
 *
 * private:
 *   int foo_;
 * };
