 *  \brief Classes that handle the HTTP protocol.
 *
 * The %Wt::%Http namespace contains classes that deal with the HTTP
 * protocol. This can be split in two groups:
 * - classes involved which deal with the server-side aspects of %Wt through WResource:
 *   - Request: a resource request
 *   - Response: a resource response
 *   - ResponseContinuation: an asynchronous response continuation object
 *   - UploadedFile: a file uploaded in the Request
 *
 * - classes that implement an HTTP client:
 *   - Client: an HTTP client
 *   - Message: a message to be sent with the client, or received from the client.
 */

/*! \class Client Wt/Http/Client Wt/Http/Client
 *  \brief An HTTP client.
 *
 * This class implements an HTTP client. It can be used to interact with
 * web services using the HTTP protocol.
 *
 * The client uses asynchronous I/O and only provides an asynchronous
 * interface: you cannot actively wait for an operation to complete,
 * instead the client will notify you of the result using the done()
 * signal.
 *
 * Because the client uses asynchronous I/O, it does its work within
 * the scope of an event-driven thread pool implementation. By
 * default, this is the same thread pool that is used by the %Wt
 * server, available through WServer::ioService(), but you may also
 * use the client by providing it an explicit I/O service to be used.
 *
 * The client supports the HTTP and HTTPS (if %Wt was built with
 * OpenSSL support) protocols, and can be used for GET and POST
 * methods. One client can do only one operation at a time.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * \code
 *    ...
 *    Http::Client *client = new Http::Client(this);
 *    client->setTimeout(15);
 *    client->setMaximumResponseSize(10 * 1024);
 *    client->done().connect(boost::bind(&MyWidget::handleHttpResponse, this, _1, _2));
 *    if (client->get("http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/blog/feed/"))
 *      WApplication::instance()->deferRendering();
 *    else {
 *      // in case of an error in the %URL
 *    }
 * }
 *
 * void handleHttpResponse(boost::system::error_code err, const Http::Message& response)
 * {
 *    WApplication::instance()->resumeRendering();
 *
 *    if (!err && response.status() == 200) {
 *       ... parse response.body()
 *    }
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The function connected to the done() signal will be run within the
 * context of the application that created the client. WServer::post()
 * is used for this.
 *
 * <h3>Basic access authentication</h3>
 * When you want to add authentication information in the %URL, this can be done
 * as <tt>https://username:password@www.example.com/</tt>. When doing this,
 * make sure that the username and password string are URL-encoded
 * (\ref Wt::Utils::urlEncode). For example,
 * <tt>https://username:pass word@www.example.com/</tt> should be passed as
 * <tt>https://username:pass%20word@www.example.com/</tt>.
