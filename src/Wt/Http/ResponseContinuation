 *  \brief A resource response continuation object.
 *
 * A response continuation object is used to keep track of a response
 * which is to be continued.
 *
 * You may associate data with the object using setData().
 *
 * A continuation is used to resume sending more data later for this
 * response. There are two possible reasons for this:
 * - the entire response is quite big and you may want to read and send
 *   it in smaller chunks. This avoids unbounded memory usage since the
 *   I/O layer buffers the response first in memory to send it then out
 *   to a possibly slow client using async I/O.
 * - you may not have any more data available, currently, but expect more
 *   data later. In that case you can call waitForMoreData() and later call
 *   WResource::haveMoreData() when more data is available.
