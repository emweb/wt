 * - stream content into out()
 *
 * You may chose to provide only a partial response. In that case, use
 * createContinuation() to create a continuation object to which you
 * can annotate information for the next request to process the
 * response further.

   * - the entire response is quite big and you may want to read and send
   *   it in smaller chunks to avoid memory consumption problems since the
   *   I/O layer buffers the response first in memory to send it then out
   *   to a possibly slow client using async I/O.
   * - you may not have any more data available, currently, but expect more
   *   data later. In that case you can call
   *   ResponseContinuation::waitForMoreData() and later call
   *   WResource::haveMoreData() when more data is available.
   *
   * A new call to handleRequest() will be made to retrieve more
   * data.
