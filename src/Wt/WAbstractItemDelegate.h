 *  \brief Abstract delegate class for rendering an item in an item view.
 *
 * Rendering of an item in a WAbstractItemView is delegated to an
 * implementation of this delegate class. The default implementation
 * used by Wt's item views is WItemDelegate. To provide specialized
 * rendering support, you can reimplement this class (or specialize
 * WItemDelegate).
 *
 * As a delegate is used for rendering multiple items, the class should
 * not keep state about one specific item.
 *
 * A delegate may provide editing support by instantiating an editor
 * when update() is called with the Wt::ViewItemRenderFlag::Editing flag. In that
 * case, you will also need to implement editState() and
 * setEditState() to support virtual scrolling and setModelData() to
 * save the edited value to the model. For an example, see the
 * WItemDelegate.

   *
   * The item is specified by its model \p index, which also

   * parameter.
   *
   * When \p widget is \c nullptr, a new widget needs to be created and returned.

   * be given a height, width and style class. In practice, that means
   * it cannot have a border or margin, and thus cannot be a
