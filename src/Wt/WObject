namespace Wt {
  /*! \brief Namespace for signal/slot implementation
   *
   * Namespace Wt::Signals offers classes for connecting signals to handlers
   * of those signals. The underlying implementation is configurable, and
   * some details may be different from one configuration to the other, but
   * the common basis is documented here.
   *
   * For now, %Wt's signals implementations are based on boost's signals
   * implementation. %Wt wraps these implementations in its own Wt::Signal
   * class, so you don't interact immediately with this object. Refer to
   * the documentation of Wt::Signal for the API description. Connection
   * lifetime management however depends on the underlying signals
   * implementation.
   *
   * A call to Wt::Signal::connect() returns a class of type
   * Wt::Signals::connection. This class allows for manual connection
   * management: if you ever want to disconnect a signal, keep a copy of the
   * connection object and invoke connection.disconnect(). Usually, you will
   * use automatic connection management as described below.
   *
   * %Wt's signal/slot implementation offers automatic connection management
   * through object lifetime tracking. With automatic connection management,
   * a signal will be disconnected when the signal's target object is
   * deleted. This lifetime tracking works, provided that the classes whose
   * lifetime has to be tracked inherit from WObject, and that the
   * Wt::WSignal class is able to detect the presence of the WObject
   * class.
   *
   * Since WObject is a base class for WWidget, the first condition
   * is fullfilled for all of %Wt's widgets, classes inheriting from widgets,
   * and other classes that inherit from WObject. For your own classes, you may
   * inherit from WObject in order to activate automatic
   * lifeteime tracking.
   *
   * The second condition, the ability for the signals library to detect this
   * WObject class, you have to know for which situations lifetime tracking
   * is supported - for all other cases, assume it's not supported. The ability
   * for the signals implementation to detect the lifetime tracked objects,
   * depends on how you invoke the connect() method.
   *
   * Any connect call where you pass the receiver of the signal directly
   * to the Wt::WSignal::connect() method as first parameter, is ok. If the
   * receiver inherits from WObject, the signal will be disconnected when
   * the receiver is deleted.
   *
   * In general, connection tracking does not work for the
   * Wt::WSignal::connect(const F &function) method. The only exception is
   * when the function pointer object was created by boost::bind, in which case
   * the receiver object (inheriting from WObject) will be tracked.
   *
   * Practical guidelines:
   * - use WSignal::connect with an explicit target parameter for connecting
   *   to slots which are member methods and for which no binding is required.
   *   This first parameter is a class derived from WObject (or inheriting
   *   from Wt::Signals::trackable, for boost signal/slot implementations)
   * - use std::bind for lambda functions, as these are not as good supported by
   *   boost::bind as std::bind. Remember that automatic connection management
   *   will not work - connecting to the signals of the receiver itself or a
   *   signal of one of its signals is generally safe, but connecting to a
   *   signal from outside your own descendants likely requires additional
   *   measurements to ensure proper lifetime tracking.
   * - use boost::bind for all other bindings, as this will offer you automatic
   *   lifetime management.
   *
   * %Wt used boost.signal (v1) as underlying implementation for its signal/slot
   * system. Since boost 1.54, boost.signal has been marked deprecated, being
   * replaced by boost.signals2. The WT_SIGNALS_IMPLEMENTATION cmake defines
   * allows you to switch between the available implementation for Wt::Signals.
   * There may be other signal/slot libraries supported in the future. With
   * the boost implementations, %Wt relies on boost::trackable for the
   * implementation of object lifetime tracking for connection management,
   * meaning that WObject inherits from boost.trackable.
   *
   * The classes of Wt::Signals are to be considered as not thread safe. Since
   * Wt has a per-session locking mechanism, under the form of the
   * WApplication::UpdateLock, this is hardly an issue. The boost.signals2
   * implementation offers some degree of thread-safety; please ensure to
   * understand its details before relying on it.

/*! \class WObject Wt/WObject Wt/WObject
 *  \brief A base class for objects that participate in the signal/slot system.
 *
 * The main feature offered by %WObject is automated object life-time
 * tracking when involved in signal/slot connections. Connections
 * between signals and slots of %WObject instances implement a
 * type-safe event callback system. For example, one can simply
 * connect() the WInteractWidget::clicked() signal of a WPushButton to
 * the WApplication::quit() method, to exit the application when the
 * button is clicked:
 *
 * \code
 * Wt::WInteractWidget *sender = new Wt::WText("Quit.");
 * Wt::WApplication *app = Wt::WApplication::instance();
 * sender->clicked().connect(app, &Wt::WApplication::quit);
 * \endcode
 *
 * %Wt's signals may also propagate arguments to slots. For example,
 * the same clicked() signal provides event details in
 * a WMouseEvent details class, and these details may be received in
 * the slot:
 * \code
 * class MyClass : public Wt::WContainerWidget
 * {
 * public:
 *   MyClass(Wt::WContainerWidget *parent = 0)
 *     : Wt::WContainerWidget(parent)
 *   {
 *     Wt::WText *text = Wt::WText("Click here", this);
 *     text->clicked().connect(this, &MyClass::handleClick);
 *
 *     ...
 *   }
 *
 * private:
 *   void handleClick(const Wt::WMouseEvent& event) {
 *     if (event.modifiers() & Wt::ShiftModifier) {
 *       ...
 *     }
 *   }
 * };
 * \endcode
 * As the example illustrates, slots are ordinary %WObject methods.
 *
 * A second feature of %WObject is that they allow ownership
 * organization in ownership object trees. When an object is created
 * with another object as parent, it's ownership is transferred to the
 * parent. If not deleted explicitly, the child object will be deleted
 * together with the parent. Child objects may also be deleted
 * manually: they will remove themselves from their parent in the
 * process.
 *
 * In conjunction with EventSignal, %WObject also facilitates learning
 * of client-side event handling (in JavaScript) through invocation of
 * the slot method. This is only possible when the slot behaviour is
 * stateless, i.e. independent of any application state, and can be
 * specified using the implementStateless() methods.
