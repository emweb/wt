/*! \class WViewWidget Wt/WViewWidget.h Wt/WViewWidget.h
 *  \brief An abstract base class for an MVC view that is rendered using a
 *         widget.
 *
 * In principle, %Wt widgets are self-contained and manage both their
 * content, behavior and layout. From the point of view of a
 * Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, they implement each of
 * these, except for the view widgets that work in conjunction with
 * WAbstractItemModel. As a developer you can chose to keep Model,
 * View and Controller together or separate them as you wish.
 *
 * This widget facilitates separation of the View from the Model and
 * Controller in a particular way. The %View is rendered as a %Wt
 * widget. The use of this widget provides two benefits. The classic
 * MVC benefit is a decoupling between view and model, which may allow
 * easier maintainance of code. In addition, this widget enforces the
 * View to be stateless, as it is only created transiently on the
 * server. Therefore the View does not require session resources. This
 * may increase scalability for Internet-deployments.
 *
 * The rendered View widget returned by renderView() should reflect
 * the current model state. Whenever the model changes, rerendering
 * can be triggered by calling update().
 *
 * Currently, the View cannot enclose \link WFormWidget
 * WFormWidgets\endlink which would allow direct manipulation of the
 * model (but we are working to remove this limitation in the future,
 * and let the Model/Controller handle editing changes) and the View
 * may only be updated by a complete rerendering of the entire view.
 *
 * The View widget may contain event handling code, but only in one of
 * the following ways:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>event handling implemented directly in JavaScript code</li>
 *   <li>event handling implemented in pre-learned stateless slot
 *     implementations</li>
 * </ul>
 * Thus, currently, event handling code related to the View cannot be
 * implemented at server-side (but we are thinking about a solution for
 * this as well...).
 *
 * \if cpp
 * Implementation example:
 * \code
 * // Shows the contents for a specific role of a model index in a WText widget
 * class SourceView : public Wt::WViewWidget
 * {
 * public:
 *   // role is the ItemDataRole
 *   SourceView(int role)
 *     : role_(role)
 *   { }
 *
 *   // set an index
 *   void setIndex(const Wt::WModelIndex& index) {
 *     if (index != index_
 *         && (!index.isValid() || !index.data(role_).empty())) {
 *       index_ = index;
 *       update(); // trigger rerendering of the view
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * private:
 *   Wt::WModelIndex index_;
 *   int             role_;
 *
 * protected:
 *   virtual std::unique_ptr<Wt::WWidget> renderView() {
 *     auto result = std::make_unique<Wt::WText>();
 *     result->setInline(false);
 *
 *     if (!index_.isValid())
 *       return result;
 *
 *     cpp17::any d = index_.data(role_);
 *     const std::string& t = cpp17::any_cast<const std::string&>(d);
 *
 *     result->setTextFormat(Wt::TextFormat::Plain);
 *     result->setText(t);
 *
 *     return result;
 *   }
 * };
 * 
 * \endcode
 * \endif
 *
 * <h3>CSS</h3>
 *
 * This widget does not provide styling, 
 * and can be styled using inline or external CSS as appropriate.
