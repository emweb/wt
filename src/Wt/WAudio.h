 *  \brief A widget that plays audio.
 *
 * This is a low-level widget, mapping directly onto a
 * <tt>&lt;audio&gt;</tt> element available in HTML5 compliant
 * browsers.
 *
 * In almost every situation you should use the WMediaPlayer widget
 * if you want the user to be able to interact with the audio, or
 * WSound for simple sound feed-back.
 *
 * Usage of the audio element consists of adding one or more audio
 * sources and setting some options. Since not every browser supports
 * HTML5 audio, the class provides a mechanism to display alternative
 * content in browsers that cannot play the video.
 *
 * \if cpp
 * Usage example:
 * \code
 * WAudio *a = parent->addChild(std::make_unique<WAudio>());
 * a->setOptions(WAudio::Controls);
 * // Addsources may be called multiple times for different formats:
 * // Firefox only plays ogg
 * a->addSource("the_wt_song.ogg");
 * // many others play mp3
 * a->addSource("the_wt_song.mp3", "audio/mp3");
 * // You may display a simple text to explain that you need html5 support...
 * // a->setAlternativeContent(new WText("You have no HTML5 Audio!"));
 * // ... or provide an alternative player, e.g. Flash-based
 * auto f = std::make_unique<WFlashObject>("player.swf");
 * f->setFlashVariable("src", "the_wt_song.mp3");
 * v->setAlternativeContent(std::move(f));
 * \endcode
 * \endif
 *
 * There are two reasons why the a browser may use the alternative
 * content: either because the browser does not support the HTML5
 * audio tag (alternative content is displayed even when JavaScript
 * is not available), or because none of the specified sources contain
 * an audio format that is understood by the browser (requires
 * JavaScript to display the alternative content).
 *
 * The addSource() and setAlternativeContent() may not be called after
 * the widget is rendered.
 *
