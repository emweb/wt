/*! \class WFileUpload Wt/WFileUpload Wt/WFileUpload
 *  \brief A widget that allows a file to be uploaded.
 *
 * This widget is displayed as a box in which a filename can be
 * entered and a browse button.
 *
 * Depending on availability of JavaScript, the behaviour of the widget
 * is different, but the API is designed in a way which facilitates
 * a portable use.
 *
 * When JavaScript is available, the file will not be uploaded until
 * upload() is called. This will start an asynchronous upload (and
 * thus return immediately). \if cpp While the file is being uploaded,
 * the dataReceived() signal is emitted when data is being received
 * and if the connector library provides support (see also
 * WResource::setUploadProgress() for a more detailed
 * discussion). Although you can modify the GUI from this signal, you
 * still need to have a mechanism in place to update the client
 * interface (using a WTimer or using \link
 * WApplication::enableUpdates() server-push\endlink). When the file
 * has been uploaded, the uploaded() signal is emitted, or if the file
 * was too large, the fileTooLarge() signal is emitted. You may
 * configure a progress bar that is used to show the upload progress
 * using setProgressBar(). \endif
 *
 * When no JavaScript is available, the file will be uploaded with the
 * next click event. Thus, upload() has no effect -- the file will
 * already be uploaded, and the corresponding signals will already be
 * emitted. To test if upload() will start an upload, you may check
 * using the canUpload() call.
 *
 * Thus, to properly use the widget, one needs to follow these
 * rules:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Be prepared to handle the uploaded() or fileTooLarge() signals
 *       also when upload() was not called.</li>
 *   <li>Check using canUpload() if upload() will schedule a new
 *       upload. if (!canUpload()) then upload() will not have any
 *       effect. if (canUpload()), upload() will start a new file upload,
 *       which completes succesfully using an uploaded() signal or a
 *       fileTooLarge() signals gets emitted.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The %WFileUpload widget must be hidden or deleted when a file is
 * received. In addition it is wise to prevent the user from uploading
 * the file twice as in the example below.
 *
 * The uploaded file is automatically spooled to a local temporary
 * file which will be deleted together with the WFileUpload widget,
 * unless stealSpooledFile() is called.
 *
 * \if cpp
 * Usage example:
 * \code
 * Wt::WFileUpload *upload = new Wt::WFileUpload(this);
 * upload->setFileTextSize(40);
 *
 * // Provide a button
 * Wt::WPushButton *uploadButton = new Wt::WPushButton("Send", this);

 * // Upload when the button is clicked.
 * uploadButton->clicked().connect(upload, &Wt::WFileUpload::upload);
 * uploadButton->clicked().connect(uploadButton, &Wt::WPushButton::disable);
 *
 * // Upload automatically when the user entered a file.
 * upload->changed().connect(upload, &WFileUpload::upload);
 * upload->changed().connect(uploadButton, &Wt::WPushButton::disable);
 *
 * // React to a succesfull upload.
 * upload->uploaded().connect(this, &MyWidget::fileUploaded);
 *
 * // React to a fileupload problem.
 * upload->fileTooLarge().connect(this, &MyWidget::fileTooLarge);
 * \endcode
 * \endif
 *
 * %WFileUpload is an \link WWidget::setInline(bool) inline \endlink widget.
 *
 * <h3>CSS</h3>
 *
 * The file upload itself corresponds to a <tt>&lt;input
 * type="file"&gt;</tt> tag, but may be wrapped in a
 * <tt>&lt;form&gt;</tt> tag for an Ajax session to implement the
 * asynchronous upload action. This widget does not provide styling,
 * and styling through CSS is not well supported across browsers.
