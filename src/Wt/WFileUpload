/*! \class WFileUpload Wt/WFileUpload Wt/WFileUpload
 *  \brief A widget that allows a file to be uploaded.
 *
 * This widget is displayed as a box in which a filename can be entered and
 * a browse button.
 *
 * Depending on availability of JavaScript, the behaviour of the widget
 * is different, but the API is designed in a way which facilitates
 * a portable use.
 *
 * When JavaScript is available, the file will not be uploaded until
 * upload() is called. This will start an asynchronous upload (and
 * thus return immediately). When the file has been uploaded, the
 * \link WFileUpload::uploaded uploaded \endlink signal is emitted, or
 * if the file was too large, the \link WFileUpload::fileTooLarge
 * fileTooLarge \endlink signal is emitted.
 *
 * When no JavaScript is available, the file will be uploaded with the
 * next click event. Thus, upload() is not useful -- the file will
 * already be uploaded, and the corresponding signals will already be
 * emitted. To test if upload() is needed, you may check using the
 * isUploaded() call.
 *
 * Thus, to properly use the widget, one needs to follow these
 * rules:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Be prepared to handle the \link WFileUpload::uploaded
 *       uploaded \endlink or \link WFileUpload::fileTooLarge
 *       fileTooLarge \endlink signal
 *       also when upload() was not called.</li>
 *   <li>Check with isUploaded() if upload() will schedule a new
 *       upload. if (isUploaded()) then upload() will no have any
 *       effect. if (!isUploaded()), upload() will start and end
 *       when either of the two signals \link WFileUpload::uploaded
 *       uploaded \endlink or \link WFileUpload::fileTooLarge
 *       fileTooLarge \endlink signal is emitted.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The %WFileUpload widget must be hidden or deleted when a file is
 * received. In addition it is wise to prevent the user from uploading
 * the file twice.
 *
 * The uploaded file is automatically spooled to a local temporary
 * file which will be deleted together with the WFileUpload widget,
 * unless stealSpooledFile() is called.
