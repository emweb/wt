/*! \class JSlot Wt/WJavaScript Wt/WJavaScript
 *  \brief A slot that is only implemented in client side JavaScript code.
 *
 * This class provides a hook for adding your own JavaScript to respond to
 * events.
 *
 * Carefully consider the use of this. Not only is writing cross-browser
 * JavaScript hard and tedious, but one must also be aware of possible
 * security problems (see further), and ofcourse, the event handling will
 * not be available when JavaScript is disabled or not present at all.
 * 
 * \if cpp
 * If you wish to add client side event handling, with automatic
 * fall-back to server-side event handling and without writing
 * JavaScript code with the associated risks and problems, consider
 * using stateless slot implementations instead (see
 * WObject::implementStateless())
 * \endif 
 *
 * For some purposes, stateless slot implementations are not
 * sufficient, since they do not allow state inspection. At the same
 * time, the non-availability in case of disabled JavaScript may also
 * be fine for some non-essential functionality (see for example the
 * WSuggestionPopup widget), or when you simply do not care. For these
 * situations a %JSlot can be used to add client-side event handling.
 *
 * The JavaScript code may be set (or changed) using the
 * setJavaScript() method which takes a string that implements a
 * JavaScript function with the following signature:
 *
 * \code
 * function(sender, event) {
 *   // handle the event, and sender is a reference to the DOM element
 *   // which captured the event (and holds the signal). Therefore it
 *   // equivalent to the sender for a normal %Wt slot.
 *
 *   // You can prevent the default action using:
 *   ${WT_CLASS}.cancelEvent(event);
 *   // (where ${WT_CLASS} should be the value of the WT_CLASS define
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * In the JavaScript code, you may use WWidget::jsRef() to obtain the
 * DOM element corresponding to any WWidget, or WWidget::id() to
 * obtain the DOM id. In addition you may trigger server-side events
 * using the JavaScript WtSignalEmit function (see JSignal
 * documentation). That's how far we can help you. For the rest you
 * are left to yourself, buggy browsers and quirky JavaScript
 * (http://www.quirksmode.org/ was a reliable companion to me) -- good
 * luck.
 *
 * Note that the slot object needs to live as long as you want the
 * JavaScript to be executed by connected signals: when the slot is
 * destroyed, the connection is destroyed just as with other
 * signal/slot connections where the target object is deleted. This
 * means that it is (almost?) always a bad idea to declare a JSlot on the
 * stack.
