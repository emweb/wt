/*! \class WTextRenderer Wt/Render/WTextRenderer Wt/Render/WTextRenderer
 *  \brief An XHTML renderering engine.
 *
 * This class implements a rendering engine for a (subset of)
 * XHTML. Its intended use is to be able to accurately render the
 * output of the WTextEdit widget (although it handles a more general
 * subset of XHTML than is required to do just that). Its focus is on
 * high-quality rendering of text-like contents.
 *
 * The following are the main features:
 * - rendering of inline content, floats, tables, images, ordered lists,
 *   unordered lists
 * - limited support for fonts, font styles, font sizes and text decorations
 * - support for text alignment options, padding, margins, borders, background
 *   color (only on block elements) and text colors
 * - supports automatic page breaks and font scaling
 * - can be used in conjunction with other drawing instructions to the same
 *   paint device.
 *
 * Some of the main limitations are:
 * - there is no CSS style resolution other than inline style definitions:
 *   the "class" attribute is ignored entirely.
 * - only "display: inline" or "display: block" elements are supported.
 *   "display: none" and "display: inline-block" are not (yet) recognized. 
 * - only normal positioning is supported (absolute positioning and relative
 *   positioning is not supported <i>yet</i>).
 * - only colors defined in terms of RGB values are supported: CSS named colors
 *   (e.g. 'blue') are not allowed.
 *
 * This class is an abstract class. A concrete class implements the
 * pure virtual methods to create an appropriate WPaintDevice for each
 * page and to provide page dimension information. The paint device
 * needs to support font metrics, which currently is only implemented
 * by WPdfImage.
 *
 * All coordinates and dimensions used by this class are pixel coordinates.
