 * \brief A value class to play a sound effect.
 *
 * This class provides a way to play an MP3 sound asynchonously (if
 * the browser supports this). It is intended as a simple way to play
 * event sounds (not quite for a media center).
 *
 * This class uses a WMediaPlayer to play the sound (using HTML
 * &lt;audio&gt; or a flash player).
 *
 * \if cpp
 * Usage example:
 * \code
 * WSound *s = new WSound("djing.mp3", parent);
 * s->setLoops(3);
 * s->play();
 * playButton->clicked().connect(s, &WSound::play);
 * stopButton->clicked().connect(s, &WSound::stop);
 * \endcode
 * \endif
