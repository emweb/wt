<!--
    Wt Configuration File.

    The Wt configuration file manages, for every Wt application, settings
    for session management, debugging, directory for runtime information
    such as session sockets, and some security settings.

    Settings may be specified globally, or for a single application path.

    The path should be as configured in the Wt build process, where it
    defaults to /etc/wt/wt_config.xml. It can be overridden in the environment
    variable WT_CONFIG_XML, or with the -c startup option of wthttp.

    The values listed here are the default values, which are used when the
    declaration is missing or no configuration file is used.

	       This mode spawns a number of processes, and sessions are
	       allocated randomly to one of these processes (you should not
	       use this for dynamic FCGI servers, but only in conjunction
	       with a fixed number of static FCGI servers.

	       This requires careful programming, as memory corruption in one
	       session will kill all of the sessions in the same process. You
	       should debug extensively using valgrind. Also, it is your
	       responsibility to keep session state not interfering and
	       seperated.

	       On the other hand, sessions are inexpensive, and this mode
	       suffers far less from DoS attacks than dedicated-process mode.
	       Use it for non-critical and well-debugged web applications.

	    <!-- Number of threads per process

               This configures the number of threads that will be used

               used to do any processing; all requests are forwarded to
               be handled in this threadpool. Rather than to configure a
               so-called 'web-garden' in IIS, increase this number. The
               ISAPI connector will not work correctly when a web-garden
               is configured.

               You may want to change this value if you would like to
               support more reentrant event loops, where you block one
               event loop using WDialog::exec() or related static

               number of thread you have (minus one to unblock).

               You may also want to increase this number if your Wt
               application is regularly waiting for IO (databases, network,
               files, ...). If this number is too low, all threads could
               be waiting for IO operations to complete while your CPU
               is idle. Increasing the number of threads may help.

               Computing intensive applications may also increase this number,
               even though it is better to offload computations to a helper
               thread and user server push or a WTimer to check for
               completion of the task in order to keep your GUI responsive
               during the computations.

               Normally, Wt keeps incoming requests (POST data) in memory.
               However, malicious users could send a big POST and as such
               use up all memory of your HTTP server. With this parameter,
               you tune how big a request can be before Wt spools it in a

               occur when users are expected to upload files.

               See also max-request-size.

               The default value is 128K, which is more than enough for

	   The configuration is a string that defines rules for

	     [-]level:scope : enables (or disables) logging of

	     that matches all levels or scopes.  The default
	     configuration is "* -debug", i.e. by default everything
	     is logged, except for "debug" messages.

	   Some other examples:

	     "* -debug debug:wthttp": logs everything, including
	     debugging messages of scope "wthttp", but no other
	     debugging messages.

	     "* -info -debug": disables logging of info messages

	   In any case, this scheme does not drop events, no matter

           By default, Wt does a browser detection to distinguish between

	<!-- Set session-ID cookie

	   In its default (and recommended) configuration, Wt does not

	   Wt has several mechanisms in place to prevent session ID stealing:
	   - for an Ajax session, the session ID is not shown in the URL,
             avoiding session ID stealing through a referer attack.
	   - in case the session ID is present in the URL (e.g. for a plain
	     HTML session), Wt will redirect links to images or external
	     anchors through an intermediate page that censors the session ID

	   In case of the loss of a session ID, the impact is minimized:
	   - a full page refresh is not supported if the client IP address
	     changes or the user-agent changes
           - an Ajax update is protected by other state which is not exposed
	     in the URL

	   To still enable a full page refresh when the client IP address
	   changes, an additional cookie may be set which is used only
	   for this purpose, and can be enabled using this setting.

	       a) use of relative URLs in included XHTML

	       When you use relative URLs for images, etc... in
	       literal XHTML fragments (e.g. in WTemplate), which need
	       to resolve against the deployment path of the
	       application. This will not work as expected in the
	       presence of an internal application path.  This URL is
	       set as base URL in the HTML, against which relative
	       URLs are resolved so that these work correctly
	       regardless of the internal path. It is also used
	       explicitly in any URL generated by the library.

	       b) widgetset mode deployments

	       Another situation in which you need to define the baseURL is
	       when deploying a widgetset mode application behind a reverse
	       proxy. A widgetset mode application uses only absolute URLs
	       because it may be hosted in a web page from an entirely
	       different domain.

	       By default, no baseURL is specified, in which case Wt will
	       avoid using absolute URLs. Relative URLs passed in API calls
	       will be "fixed" so that they resolve against the location of the
