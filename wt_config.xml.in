<!--
    Wt Configuration File.

    The Wt configuration file manages, for every Wt application, settings
    for session management, debugging, directory for runtime information
    such as session sockets, and some security settings.

    Settings may be specified globally, or for a single application path.

    The path should be as configured in the Wt build process, where it
    defaults to /etc/wt/wt_config.xml. It can be overridden in the environment
    variable WT_CONFIG_XML, or with the -c startup option of wthttpd.

    The values listed here are the default values, which are used when the
    declaration is missing or no configuration file is used.

	       This mode guarantees kernel-level session privacy, but as every
	       session requires a seperate process, it is also an easy target
	       for DoS attacks if not shielded by access control.

               It is also a convenient mode during development, as it is easy
	       to enable disable debugging using valgrind, and it always starts
	       the latest deployed executable for a new session.

	       This mode spawns a number of processes, and sessions are
	       allocated randomly to one of these processes (you should not
	       use this for dynamic FCGI servers, but only in conjunction
	       with a fixed number of static FCGI servers.

	       This requires careful programming, as memory corruption in one
	       session will kill all of the sessions in the same process. You
	       should debug extensively using valgrind. Also, it is your
	       responsibility to keep session state not interfering and
	       seperated.

	       On the other hand, sessions are inexpensive, and this mode
	       suffers far less from DoS attacks than dedicated-process mode.
	       Use it for non-critical and well-debugged web applications.

               requests; the client therefore cancels the request
               periodically and issues a new one. This timeout sets

               number of thread you have (minus one to unblock).

	       For the built-in http connector, there is a similar

	    <!-- Number of threads per process

               This configures the number of threads that will be used
               to handle Wt requests. The IIS internal threads are never
               used to do any processing; all requests are forwarded to
               be handled in this threadpool. Rather than to configure a
               so-called 'web-garden' in IIS, increase this number. The
               ISAPI connector will not work correctly when a web-garden
               is configured.

               You may want to change this value if you would like to
               support more reentrant event loops, where you block one
               event loop using WDialog::exec() or related static
               methods. Everytime you enter such an event loop, one
               thread is blocked, and therefore the total number of
               sessions that reliably can do this is limited to the
               number of thread you have (minus one to unblock).

               You may also want to increase this number if your Wt
               application is regularly waiting for IO (databases, network,
               files, ...). If this number is too low, all threads could
               be waiting for IO operations to complete while your CPU
               is idle. Increasing the number of threads may help.

               Computing intensive applications may also increase this number,
               even though it is better to offload computations to a helper
               thread and user server push or a WTimer to check for
               completion of the task in order to keep your GUI responsive
               during the computations.

               The default value is 10.

	    <!-- Maximum Request Size spooled in memory (Kb)
        
               Normally, Wt keeps incoming requests (POST data) in memory.
               However, malicious users could send a big POST and as such
               use up all memory of your HTTP server. With this parameter,
               you tune how big a request can be before Wt spools it in a
               file before processing it. Legitimate big POST messages may
               occur when users are expected to upload files.

               See also max-request-size.

               The default value is 128K, which is more than enough for
               any interactive Wt event.

	<!-- Send the XHTML mime type when appropriate

	   Wt renders XHTML1 (XML variant of HTML) that is backward-compatible
	   with HTML. Using XHTML, Wt is capable of supporting XHTML-only
	   features such as embedded SVG or MathML.

	   When enabled, JWt sets an XHTML mime-type
	   (application/xhtml+xml) when the browser reports support
	   for it. Most notably, Internet Explorer does not support
	   it.  Because XHTML and HTML are slightly different with
	   respect to default CSS rules, you may want to disable
	   sending the XHTML mime-type alltogether, at least if you
	   are not using SVG (used by the WPaintedWidget).  -->
	<send-xhtml-mime-type>false</send-xhtml-mime-type>

	<!-- Do strict serialization of events.

	   By default events are queued at the client-side, and
	   transmitted to the server so that at any time only one
	   request/response is pending. This scheme has a quality that
	   resembles TCP: on a low-latency link you allow the
	   transmission of many smaller requests, while on a high
	   latency link, events will be propagated less often, but in
	   batches.

	   In any case, this scheme does not drop events, no matter
	   how quickly they are generated.

	   In rare cases, the scheme may result in unwanted behaviour,
	   because the client-side is allowed to be slighly out of
	   sync at the time an event is recorded with the server-side
	   (and more so on high-latency links). The drastic
	   alternative is to discard events while a response is
	   pending, and can be configured by setting this option to
	   true.
	  -->
	<strict-event-serialization>false</strict-event-serialization>

	<!-- Enables web socket.

	   By default AJAX and long polling are used to communicate
	   between server and browser.

           By enabling web socket support, if the browser supports
           WebSockets, then WebSocket is the protocol used for
           communication between client and server. WebSockets are
           currently only supported by the built-in httpd Connector,
	   which acts as both an HTTP and WebSocket server. The WebSocket
	   protocol is intentionally not compatible with HTTP, through 
	   a special hand-shake mechanism, and requires
           that all (reverse) proxy servers also have explicit support
           for this protocol.

           This feature is still experimental: the Web Sockets RFC is
           still a draft with ongoing changes to the framing protocol,
	   and the current implementation is based on
	   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-00

	<web-sockets>false</web-sockets>

	<!-- Redirect message shown for browsers without JavaScript support

	   By default, Wt will use an automatic redirect to start the
	   application when the browser does not support
	   JavaScript. However, browsers are not required to follow
	   the redirection, and in some situations (when using XHTML),
	   such automatic redirection is not supported.

	   This configures the text that is shown in the anchor which
	   the user may click to be redirected to a basic HTML version
	   of your application.

	<!-- Whether we are sitting behind a reverse proxy

	<!-- Ajax user agent list

           Wt considers three types of sessions:
	   - AJAX sessions: use AJAX and JavaScript
	   - plain HTML sessions: use plain old server GETs and POSTs
	   - bots: have clean internal paths and no persistent sessions

           By default, Wt does a browser detection to distinguish between
	   the first two: if a browser supports JavaScript (and has it
	   enabled), and has an AJAX DOM API, then AJAX sessions are chosen,
	   otherwise plain HTML sessions.

           Here, you may indicate which user agents should or should
           not receive an AJAX session regardless of what they report as
	   capabilities.

           Possible values for 'mode' or "white-list" or "black-list". A
	   white-list will only treat the listed agents as supporting AJAX,
	   all other agents will be served plain HTML sessions. A black-list
	   will always server plain HTML sessions to listed agents and
	   otherwise rely on browser capability detection.
