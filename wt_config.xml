<!--
    Wt Configuration File.

    The Wt configuration file manages, for every Wt application, settings
    for session management, debugging, directory for runtime information
    such as session sockets, and some security settings.

    Settings may be specified globally, or for a single application path.

    The path should be as configured in the Wt build process, where it
    defaults to /etc/wt/wt_config.xml. It can be overridden in the environment
    variable WT_CONFIG_XML, or with the --config startup option of wthttpd.

            <!-- Every session runs within a dedicated process.

	       This mode guarantees kernel-level session privacy, but as every
	       session requires a seperate process, it is also an easy target
	       for DoS attacks if not shielded by access control.

               It is also a convenient mode during development, as it is easy
	       to enable disable debugging using valgrind, and it always starts
	       the latest deployed executable for a new session.
	   
	       Note: currently only supported using the FastCGI connector

	    <!-- Multiple sessions within one process.

	       This mode spawns a number of processes, and sessions are
	       allocated randomly to one of these processes (you should not
	       use this for dynamic FCGI servers, but only in conjunction
	       with a fixed number of static FCGI servers.

	       This requires careful programming, as memory corruption in one
	       session will kill all of the sessions in the same process. You
	       should debug extensively using valgrind. Also, it is your
	       responsibility to keep session state not interfering and
	       seperated.

	       On the other hand, sessions are inexpensive, and this mode
	       suffers far less from DoS attacks than dedicated-process mode.
	       Use it for non-critical and well-debugged web applications.

	       Note: wthttpd always uses exactly one process

	    <!-- How reload should be handled.

	       When reload should (or rather, may) spawn a new session, then
	       even in the case cookies are not used for session management,
	       the URL will not be cluttered with a sessionid.

	       Allow debugging by appending 'debug' to the initial query for

	    <enable-debug>true</enable-debug>

	    <!-- Valgrind path

               If debugging is enabled and this path is not empty, then valgrind
	       will be started for every shared process, or for every session
	       which has ?debug appended to the command line.

	       The variable is slighly misnamed. Not only a path can be set,
	       but also options, like for example:

                 /usr/bin/valgrind --leak-check=full
             -->
	    <valgrind-path></valgrind-path>

	    <!-- Number of threads per process

               This configures the size of the thread pool. You may want to
	       change this value if you would like to support reentrant event
	       loops, where you block one event loop using WDialog::exec() or
	       related static methods. Everytime you enter such an event loop,
	       one thread is blocked, and therefore the total number of
	       sessions that reliably can do this is limited to the number
	       of thread you have (minus one to unblock).

	       For the built-in http connector, there is a similar config
	       option that is specified in the whttpd config file or on the
	       command line (--num-threads).

               The default value is 10.

	    <num-threads>10</num-threads>

	<!-- Log file

	   When the log file is empty, or omitted, logging is done to
	   stderr. This may end up in the web server error log file
	   (e.g. for apache + fastcgi module), or on stderr (e.g. for
	   the built-in httpd).

	<!-- Send the XHTML mime type when appropriate

	   Wt renders XHTML1 (XML variant of HTML) that is backward-compatible
	   with HTML. In this way, Wt is capable of supporting XHTML-only
	   features such as embedded SVG or MathML.

	   The browser renders the document as XHTML or HTML depending on the
	   mime-type that is set. By default Wt sets an XHTML mime-type
	   (application/xhtml+xml) when the browser reports support for it. Most
	   notably, Internet Explorer does not support it.  Because XHTML and
	   HTML are slightly different with respect to default CSS rules, you
	   may want to disable sending the XHTML mime-type alltogether, at least
	   if you are not using SVG (used by the WPaintedWidget).
	  -->
	<send-xhtml-mime-type>false</send-xhtml-mime-type>

	<!-- Do strict serialization of events.

	   By default events are queued at the client-side, and
	   transmitted to the server so that at any time only one
	   request/response is pending. This scheme has a quality that
	   resembles TCP: on a low-latency link you allow the
	   transmission of many smaller requests, while on a high
	   latency link, the events be propagated less often, but in
	   batches.

	   In any case, this scheme does not drop events, no matter
	   how quickly they are generated.

	   In rare cases, the scheme may result in unwanted behaviour,
	   because the client-side is allowed to be slighly out of
	   sync at the time an event is recorded with the server-side
	   (and more so on high-latency links). The drastic
	   alternative is to discard events while a response is
	   pending, and can be configured by setting this option to
	   true.
	  -->
	<strict-event-serialization>false</strict-event-serialization>

	<!-- Redirect message shown for browsers without JavaScript support

	   By default, Wt will use an automatic redirect to start the
	   application when the browser does not support JavaScript. However,
	   browsers are not required to follow the redirection, and in some
           situations (when using XHTML), such automatic redirection is not
           supported.

	   This configures the text that is shown in the anchor which
	   the user may click to be redirected to a basic HTML version of
           your application.
          -->
	<redirect-message>Load basic HTML</redirect-message>

	<!-- Whether we are sitting behind a reverse proxy 

	   When deployed behind a reverse proxy (such as Apache or Squid),
