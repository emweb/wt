    <h2>WTreeView example</h2>

    <p>This example illustrates the WTreeView widget. This widget is
    part of Wt's MVC widgets, and are an alternative to the WTree, and
    WTreeTable widgets which are not MVC.</p>

    <p>The widget supports very large models by loading only the
    visible region (with some margin) in the browser. This results in
    low memory consumption (on client and server) and fast load
    times.</p>

    <p>This example uses a WStandardItemModel to populate the tree
    table. As is demonstrated, various roles may be used to indicate
    text, icons, selectable items (through check boxes), and also URLs
    or internal paths.</p>

    <p>Many aspects of the tree view widget are not illustrated here,
    such as the various supported selection behaviors and modes, and
    reacting to item click events</p>

    <p>Except for the selection of items, the view does not yet offer
    the possibility to modify the model. Together with more fine
    grained control of how to display the data through delegates,
    support for editing will be added in the near future.</p>

    <h3>Drink: wine</h3>

    <p>
      Not only because of their renowned chauvinism are French people
      so proud of their wine: they have plenty of good wines to brag
      about. <br />
