    <h1>Using WVideo</h1>
    <p>
      Although the
      <tt>WMediaPlayer</tt> implements a cross-browser video player,
      in some cases, one may want direct access to a native
      HTML <tt>&lt;video&gt;</tt> element. This is provided by
      the <tt>WVideo</tt> widget.

    <h2>Native video</h2>
    <p>
      Below is the video class, with a <tt>WImage</tt> (a static JPEG
      image) as fallback. The video will play on browsers that support
      MP4 or OGV video streams (firefox, chrome, safari, ...)
      natively (using HTML <tt>&lt;video&gt;</tt>), and show the image on other
      browsers (Internet Explorer, opera, ...).

    <h2>Native video with Flash player fall-back</h2>
    <p>
      For browsers that support HTML <tt>&lt;video&gt;</tt>, this
      video below looks exactly like the one above. On other browsers,
      the player below falls back to a Flash player, which plays an
      MP4 video. If flash is not supported on your system, a static
      image is shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Flash-based video player can be any player. The example
      below uses <a href="http://flv-player.net/" target="_blank">FLV
      Player</a> as fallback for HTML5 video, but any flash player can
      do the job.
