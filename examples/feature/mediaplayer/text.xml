    <h1>Using WMediaPlayer</h1>
    <p>
      <tt>WMediaPlayer</tt> provides an interactive audio/video
      player, with flexible support for user-interface controls, and
      good cross-browser support through a combination of native HTML
      elements (<tt>&lt;video&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;audio&gt;</tt>) and
      flash fall-back.
    </p>

    <p>
      A unique feature of the video player is that regardless of the
      technology used for video playback, the same <tt>WWidget</tt>
      may be used to implement the controls, using native form
      elements. In this way, the user-interface is easily customized
      and adapted to your needs and skinned using CSS.

      Below shows the media player with its default controls. The
      player will look identical on all browsers. The default controls
      show below the player, but using CSS, or by customizing the
      controls, any effect can be achieved including showing the
      controls when hovering over the lower part of the video player
      (as is also evident from the full-screen mode).
