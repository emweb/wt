style example
-------------

This example creates a new widget (`RoundedWidget`) which adds rounded
corners to a child widget, using images that are rendered on the fly
with the painting API.

This example is a bit dated since CSS3 now includes rounded corners
which are already broadly supported across browsers.

How to run
----------

See the README in the parent directory.

What it illustrates
-------------------

- how to use `WCompositeWidget` to define new widgets
- how to use `WResource` for on-the-fly generated images
- how to use `WRasterImage` with the painting API for painting raster images.
