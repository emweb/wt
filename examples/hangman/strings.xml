    Hangman keeps track of the best players, and since that could be
    you, you might want to register. <br/>
    If you would rather not register for some reason, use the

      For each game won, you gain 20 points, minus one point for each
      wrong letter guess. <br />

      For each game lost, you loose 10 points, so you better try hard
      to guess the word!
